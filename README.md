# hourchallenge

this is a flutter UI/UX design implementation challenge within an a duration of 1 - 2 hours
under this i m going to implement a design from dribble by https://dribbble.com/tatechow 
using flutter and dart programming.

// pull and check it on your machine
i haven't implement the navigation and button click and stuff like that,but to check the screens you can change the home: tag under the Material app and take a look to both screens. comment on it or do whatever you like. 

there are two statefull Widget classes
1. InsideRestaurant
2. InsideCart

the first one is the first screen design implementation and the second for the cart design
